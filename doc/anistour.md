**Role:** Backend Developer

**Tools:** Laravel, AWS, MySQL, Docker

As a Backend Developer at Diraya Inc., I contributed to refactoring and improving a legacy codebase to ensure better scalability, maintainability, and code quality. My work involved implementing clean architecture, applying SOLID principles, and enhancing API performance and structure. I wrote unit, integration, and feature tests to ensure reliability and minimize bugs. I also collaborated closely with frontend teams to integrate services and deploy updates using Docker and GitHub Actions.

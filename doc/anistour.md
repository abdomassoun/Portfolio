# AnisTour (Rental Car Management System)

**Role:** Full Stack Development

**Tools:** Laravel, Livewire, MySQL, Bootstrap

I developed a Rental Car Management System for a freelance project. The system includes features such as rental car management, order tracking, payment tracking, employee management, customer tracking, and multi-role user functionality. It is built using Laravel, a full-stack PHP framework, and utilizes Livewire for interactive UI components. The database is managed using MySQL, and the frontend is styled using Bootstrap.

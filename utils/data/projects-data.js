      "At Diraya Inc., I worked on refactoring a legacy Laravel backend to improve scalability, readability, and maintainability. I applied SOLID principles, introduced clean architecture patterns, and developed RESTful APIs. The project also included writing unit, feature, and integration tests, integrating third-party services, and managing Dockerized deployments.",

      "I worked as a Backend Developer on the VitePay project. I designed and developed RESTful APIs for data integration between applications. I deployed the web application onto servers using the Digital Ocean platform and Ubuntu, leveraging Docker for efficient containerization. I integrated notification and messaging services such as Pusher, Mailtrap, and Firebase for enhanced communication functionalities. I collaborated closely with a team of developers to architect and build a dynamic web application from inception. I maintained high standards of code quality by writing clean, well-documented, and reusable code components. I also created and maintained databases using MySQL.",
